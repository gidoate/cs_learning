This repository contains material I am developing while I teach myself computer science and embedded systems development.
Training courses on: computer HW, Algorithms, C-Coding, Data structures.... 
I am also learning about CI/CD and DevOps - see my progress in the following repo: https://github.com/gidoate/devops_training

Projects:

Project 1 | Brayton Cycle model    | Programming Language: Python | Status: completed (validated)
Project 2 | Turbo Jet Engine model | Programming Language: Python | Status: ongoing (long-term project) | Next steps: nozzle modeling, integration with brayton cycle

Course completion:

CS01 (completed - 100%) - The elements of computing systems I (From Nand2Tetris I) - The Hebrew Universtity of Jerusalem
  Projects:
      1. Project 1 - Building Logic gates 
      2. Project 2 - Building ALU 
      3. Project 3 - Builiding Computer memory chips (RAM and ROM)
      4. Project 4 - Hack Computer assembly language (2x instruction (A, C) + 3x registers (A, D, M) assembly language)
      5. Project 5 - Implementing the Von-Neuman Architecture
      6. Project 6 - Building the assembler (hand-written version and coding version)

CS02 (ongoing - 90%) - CS50x 2025 - Harvard University
  Main topics:
      1. Programming basics in C - hello world!, arrays, debugging, recursion, structures, pointers, file I/O 
      2. Computing science foundamentals - machine language, assembly language, memory hierarchy (heap, stack, buffer overflow...)
      3. Algorithms - Big O notation, linear search, binary search, sorting algorithms
      4. SQL - Lecture to be completed
      ...

CS03 (ongoing - 60%) - Algorithms and Data structures - based on book "Grokking Algorithms" (Aditya Y. Bhargava)
  Main topics:
      0. Programming fundamentals: recursion
      1. Algorithms: Big O notiation, Linear search, Binary search, Selection sort, Quick sort
      2. Data structures: Arrays, Linked lists, Hash tables
      ...

CS04 (not started) - The elements of computing systems II (From Nand2Tetris II) - The Hebrew University of Jerusalem
  This course requires some previous knowledge of high-level programming languages (Java, Python...).
  Because of this, I decided to jump into Course 5 (Python Language) and come back to this course later on

CS05 (ongoing - 100%) - Python Language - based on book "Python crash course" (Eric Matthes, 2016)
  Main topics:
      1. Lists, User input, File handling
      2. While and For loops
      3. If Statements, Functions
      4. Object oriented programming - classes
  Projects:
      1. Project 1 - Alien invasion (ongoing)
      2. Project 2 - Learning log webpage (completed)
         Project consisting of building a webpage for a learning log using DJANGO framework and django-bootstrap5
         Contents:
          - Models (databases), views, urls, views
          - Topics, Entries, ADD-DELETE buttons
          - User register, Log in, Content ownership

CS99 (ongoing) - General learning of C Language
