This repository contains material I am developing while I teach myself computer science and embedded systems development.
Training courses on: computer HW, Algorithms, C-Coding, Data structures.... 

Course completion:

Course 1 (completed - 100%) - The elements of computing systems I (From Nand 2 Tetris I) - The Hebrew Universtity of Jerusalem
  Projects:
      1. Project 1 - Building Logic gates 
      2. Project 2 - Building ALU 
      3. Project 3 - Builiding Computer memory chips (RAM and ROM)
      4. Project 4 - Hack Computer assembly language (2x instruction (A, C) + 3x registers (A, D, M) assembly language)
      5. Project 5 - Implementing the Von-Neuman Architecture
      6. Project 6 - Building the assembler (hand-written version and coding version)

  Main topics:
      1. Programming basics (C, Python, SQL) - hello world!, arrays, debugging, recursion, structures, pointers, file I/O 
      2. Computing science foundamentals - machine language, assembly language, memory hierarchy (heap, stack, buffer overflow...)
      3. Algorithms - Big O notation, linear search, binary search, sorting algorithms
      ...

Course 3 (ongoing - 40%) - Algorithms and Data structures - based on book "Grokking Algorithms" (Aditya Y. Bhargava)
