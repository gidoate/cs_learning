STAGE 1 (completed)
Reference - Moran and Shapiro - Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics (eight edition), 2014
Assumptions of the model at stage 1:

1. No losses - compression and expansion are 100% efficient (isentropic)
2. Perfect gas behaviour (constant cp, cv)
3. No pressure drops in the combustion chamber
4. No mechanical losses in bearing or blades
5. The temperature rise that would be brouht about by combustion is accomplished by a heat transfer from an external source
   Avoids complexity of combustion process and the change in composition during combustion

STAGE 2 (completed)
Implementation of real gas properties (non-constan cp, cv)

This stage was validated with example 9.4 of Moran&Shapiro 2014
