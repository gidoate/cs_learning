STAGE 1 (completed)
Reference - Moran and Shapiro - Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics (eight edition), 2014 / Saravanamuttoo - Gas Turbine theory (fifth edition), 2001
Assumptions of the model at stage 1:

1. Compression and expansion processes are reversible and adiabatic (i.e. isentropic)
2. The change of kinetic energy of the working frluid between the inlet and the outlet of each component is negligible
3. No pressure losses in the inlet ducting, combustion chamber, heat exchangers, intercoolers, exhaust ducting and any other ducting
2. Perfect gas behaviour (constant cp, cv)
3. Mass flow of gas is constant along the cycle
4. Heat transfer in the heat-exchangers is complete - no difference between the open and closed cycles
5. The temperature rise that would be brouht about by combustion is accomplished by a heat transfer from an external source
   Avoids complexity of combustion process and the change in composition during combustion

STAGE 2 (completed)
Implementation of real gas properties (non-constan cp, cv)

This stage was validated with example 9.4 of Moran&Shapiro 2014
