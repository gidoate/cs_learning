// Reading, Writing, Creating and Closing files //

FILE is a type defined in the standard I/O library (stdio.h) that represents a file stream.
It is used to handle file operations such as reading, writing, and closing files.
The FILE type is essentially a structure that contains information about the file, including its current position, error status, and other attributes.

fopen(file, mode) function to open a file and obtain a FILE pointer
    Here are some common modes you can use with fopen:
    "r": Open for reading. The file must exist.
    "w": Open for writing. If the file exists, its contents are truncated. If the file does not exist, it is created.
    "a": Open for appending. Data is written to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it is created.
    "r+": Open for reading and writing. The file must exist.
    "w+": Open for reading and writing. If the file exists, its contents are truncated. If the file does not exist, it is created.
    "a+": Open for reading and appending. Data is written to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it is created.

fgets, fscanf, or fread to read data from the file, they are part of the standard I/O library (stdio.h)
    The fgets function knows it has reached the end of the file (EOF) when it encounters the end-of-file indicator while reading
    feof function in C is used to check if the end-of-file (EOF) indicator associated with a file stream is set. 

fprintf, fputs (to write a string), fputc (to write a character) or fwrite to write data to the file
fclose function to close the file and release resources
