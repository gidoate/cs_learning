THE ELEMENTS OF COMPUTING SYSTEMS II (From NAND to TETRIS II)

"NAND 2 TETRIS II" is an advanced course that builds on the foundational knowledge from the first part, guiding students through the creation of a complete computer system.
This course delves deeper into the software aspects, covering topics such as high-level programming languages, compilers, and operating systems.

Students learn to:

1. Develop a compiler for a high-level language.
2. Design and implement an operating system.
3. Integrate the hardware and software components to create a fully functional computer system.

By the end of the course, I will have a comprehensive understanding of both the hardware and software layers of computer systems.
This hands-on, project-based learning experience further bridges the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation, providing a holistic view of computing.

This course corresponds to the second part of the full training - from Hack Computer to a complete computer system (Compiler, Operating System, and high-level programming language).
