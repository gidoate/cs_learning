when looking into our stm32-based project, I see the following way to implement cmsis:

use NXP HAL layer (already available)
use FreeRtos (already available)
add cmsis files (e.g. get the from stm32-based project, available via STM)
used files will be cmsis_os.c, cmsis_os.h, core_cmFunc.h, cmsis_gcc.h
adapt cmsis_gcc.h to NXP processor (only a few assembly functions)
I do not see a copyright problem with this solution. The copyright is always mentioned in the source files.


As I understand, we need the following packs:

cmsis
cmsis-freertos (FreeRtos that is supporting cmsis)
cmsis pack (this is probably some kind of porting layer HW ó cmsis, but I do not know exactly)
For further specific questions for porting CMSIS/ FreeRtos to our processor, please contact NXP or ARM KEIL.

please use:

- FreeRtos V10.5.1

- cmsis API V1.02 or V1.03 (only document changes)

How to use cmsis:

https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/RTOS/html/usingOS.html

get cmsis:

https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/cmsis-arm/versions/

version 4.1.0 (using API 1.02)

get cmsis-freertos:

https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-FreeRTOS/releases

version 10.5.1

get ARM cmsis pack:

https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/

ask keil for cmsis pack for S32K146

or maybe this helps:
