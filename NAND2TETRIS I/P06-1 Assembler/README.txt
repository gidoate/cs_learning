HACK ASSEMBLER - First coding attempt

This is my first attempt to solve the assembler in C code by myself. My limited coding skills and architectural knowledge have 
led me to a situation where continuation is nearly impossible, as I do not know how to proceed with the code and the solution.

I am confident that this is a good approach (correct, at least), although it might not be highly efficient.
As of today, it has been just five months since I started learning about computer science and began coding.

I decided to search for the code on the internet, read it, understand the architecture and implementation, and then move on
to other tasks, as this project may be too complex to complete with my current skills and knowledge.

I intend to revisit this project in the future and complete it independently once I have gained more experience.

Please proceed to P06-2 Assembler to see the solution I found and followed.
