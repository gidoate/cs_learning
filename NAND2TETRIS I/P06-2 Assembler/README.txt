HACK ASSEMBLER

This project is based on existing work found on the internet.
I do not claim authorship of this code; rather, I utilized it as a means to complete the project in C.
SOURCE - https://github.com/zakuArbor/hackAssembler

Justification:
At the time of completing this course, I am not sufficiently proficient in C or any other programming language to undertake this project independently.
After initially completing the parper-based option, I decided to try coding it. Despite several weeks of effort, seeking support online and using GPT tools, I found that
my limited programming skills rendered the task nearly impossible to complete.

Consequently, I decided to search the internet for pre-existing solutions coded in C. I analyzed these solutions to understand their architecture and key implementation aspects.
Meanwhile, I continued practicing C coding exercises and learning other languages such as Python and SQL.

I intend to revisit this project in the future to optimize the code once I have acquired more programming knowledge.
